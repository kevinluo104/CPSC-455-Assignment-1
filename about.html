    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutMe">Hi! My name is Kevin and I am currently a 5th year student double majoring
        in Computer Science and Atmospheric Science! My hobbies include listening to music, playing the guitar,
        snowboarding, working out, and weather. I am extremely excited to be taking this course as the MERN
        stack is something that is new to me, and I look forward to creating a project that can be of practical use in the future.
